# non-translated-wiki
English wikipedia pages that doesnt have been translated to arabic


first time you have to run install.py file to instal dependencies (modules: mysql and tqdm) 
then you can run wiki.py.
it will create new folder "sql" then it will download two big sql files (1GB+) each, so it may take very long time to setup app for the first time (time depend on your machine).

enjoy :)
